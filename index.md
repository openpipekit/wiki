This wiki is a repository of text files on Github ([link](https://github.com/openpipekit/wiki)). You can edit them directly on Github or fork and send us a pull request. Whichever suits your fancy. You'll just need to request in the [issue queue](https://github.com/openpipekit/wiki/issues) for your account to have permission to edit directly.
